CardDrop is a cloud-enabled full fledged WebApp.

  - Drop your business card at any location
  - Magic :fireworks:
  - Find and receive cards from a location in a radius of 500mt.
  - Geo Location Enabled. :earth_asia:

### Tech :heartpulse:

CardDrop uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [ReactJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [Spring Boot] - Spring MVC on steroids. :pill:
* [MongoDB] - Most popular non relational database.
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Package manager

### Installation

CardDrop requires Maven and Node to run.

Install the dependencies to start the server.
Maven automatically downloads all the dependencies.

```sh
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

For react frontend...

```sh

```

### Plugins

Carddrop's front end is currently extended with the numerous plugins
mostly belonging to React.
